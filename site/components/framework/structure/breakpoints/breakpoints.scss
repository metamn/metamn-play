// Set in px instead of em for the following resons
// - em is set by the font-size, px is not. This way breakpoints stays always the same no matter the base font size
// - typography might be responsive, so they use first breakpoints and not vice versa
// - breakpoints in this project depends on image size which is set in pixels

// Screens smaller than 320px
$breakpoint-mobile: 320px;

// Screens starting from 600px
$breakpoint-tablet: 600px;
